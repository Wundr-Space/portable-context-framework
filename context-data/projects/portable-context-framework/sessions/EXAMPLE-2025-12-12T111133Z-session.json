  "summary": "Built a complete MCP server for capturing and querying development context. Implemented three tools: add_context (captures sessions with commits, chat URLs, tags), query_context (searches by keywords/tags), and get_timeline (chronological view). Created automatic installation script that detects OS, validates Node.js, builds the server, and configures Claude Desktop. Added comprehensive documentation with troubleshooting guides. Key decision: Keep storage simple with file-based JSON (no database) for Phase 1 MVP. All tests pass.",
